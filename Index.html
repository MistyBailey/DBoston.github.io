				<h2>Traditional Japanese Art</h2> 
			</div> 
					
			<p> 
		Japanese modern design started in the 1940’s, shortly after WWII. At the time, traditional Japanese design was influenced primarily by traditional artforms of the region and carried high importance in technique and craftsmanship. The use of natural materials and muted tones with relatively simple, centered composition carried symbolism with Japanese principles.

				<h2>Japanese Design Principles</h2> 
			</div> 
					
			<p> 
		The Japanese had five traditional design principles: Wabi was the aesthetic of deterioration and patina. Natural materials were critical with this element because of their ability to show age. Sabi was the concept of beauty in imperfection which coincides with Wabi. The two principles combine to form a third element, Wabi-Sabi, or imperfect, impermanent and incomplete. A good example of this is the aging and breakdown of indigo denim through normal wear, as well as the patches and stitching used to repair the garment. The repairs, unrepairable parts, and unworn parts all combine to become one unique beautiful article of clothing. Mono no Aware, the fourth principle, is the awareness of other things that exist around, before and after oneself. Designing with the thought that something won’t last forever, so the product’s design needs to be thoughtful of its lasting impact. Ma, the term used for pauses in space and time, is the final principle of Japanese design. For example, ma can be the long pauses in conversation that allow for reflection. Space is utilized in every aspect of life and it is valued for the audience to fill in the blanks or draw one’s own conclusions. These five principles carried over from traditional design to modern.

				<h2>Constructivism arrives in Japan</h2> 
			</div> 
					
			<p> 
		Constructivism, by contrast, held a total acceptance and commitment to modernity. It was absolute abstract with an emphasis on geometric shapes and experimentation. Though constructivism was optimistic, it was not emotional in any way; subjectivity and individuality were replaced with objective, universal forms. The artworks were reductive in nature, simplifying everything to the fundamentals.
As Japan’s involvement in the war increased, constructivism worked its way east. The traditional Japanese design began to embody the link to industry and manufacturing that made the Russian style so identifiable. Western influence from the Dada movement and American design led to more adjustments and Japan began to develop a style unto itself.

				<h2>Yusaku Kamekura</h2> 
			</div> 
					
			<p> 
		This new Japanese design had a strong focus on problem solving and the utilization of symbolic references. Use of constructivist forms and techniques with these attributes led to symmetrical, often centered imagery with plenty of negative space and balance in the work. This use of negative space is an example of Ma. 
One of the first to establish Japanese modern design was Yusaku Kamekura. His two most notable mainstream achievements were the poster for Expo ‘70 and the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. The Olympic games poster was rather simple with a large white negative space, a red circle representing Japan’s Rising Sun, and simple gold type. Kemekura, who developed the moniker Boss, was known for utilizing vibrant colors, Pulled influence from Western Europe as well as Russia.

				<h2>Ikko Tanaka</h2> 
			</div> 
					
			<p> 
		Ikko Tanaka was another well known designer from Japan. He brought Western influence to Japan with his typography. Brush strokes were rounded and tweaked to develop new character fonts, and various languages would find themselves together on the same work to develop an entirely new style. Colors and contrast became even more important, with heavy emphasis on negative space. Tanaka also combined the constructivist angular and geometric shapes with traditional Japanese figures to create new takes on human form.  One of his more famous works is the poster for the Asian Performance Arts Institute’s Nihon Buyo Performance.
